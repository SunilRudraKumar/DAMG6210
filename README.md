DMDD Project Title: Red Eye
Discriminating the areas based on safety and affordability

Team Member: Sunil Rudrakumar

Tools: Mysql and Related tools.

Description:

The primary objective of this project is to present an overview of safety concerns in multiple locations surrounding the university; later, this will be broadened to include specifics on affordability, ease of transportation to the university, and other concerns that an international student may have.

This project can be expanded in different directions and will be subject to time availability; I will be the sole person working on it.
